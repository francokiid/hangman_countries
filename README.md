# HANGMAN: COUNTRIES

  Hangman: Countries is a classic word game in which a player has to guess a random country one letter at a time. For every failed attempt, a chance is lost and a new body part is hanged, bringing the man closer to death. Notably, only one-letter inputs are considered as guesses. The program does not accept non-alphabet inputs nor repeated guesses. 
  If the player guesses the country before the drawing is finished, the player wins and the man is saved; otherwise, the computer wins and the man is hanged.

To play the hame:
  - Download the ZIP, extract it, and open it in your IDE.
  - Before running the program, make sure you have downloaded the needed modules (i.e., pathlib, random, time, os, system).
  - Run the module: hangman_main.py.
