# HANGMAN: COUNTRIES

Hangman: Countries is a classic word game in which a player has to guess a random country one letter at a time. Every failed attempt brings the man closer to being hanged. If the player guesses the country before the drawing is finished, the player wins; otherwise, the man is hanged and the computer wins.
