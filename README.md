# HANGMAN: COUNTRIES

  Hangman: Countries is a classic word game in which a player has to guess a random country one letter at a time. For every failed attempt, a chance is lost and a new body part is hanged, bringing the man closer to death. If the player guesses the country before the drawing is finished, the player wins and the man is saved; otherwise, the computer wins and the man is hanged.

Important Notes: 
  - To play the game, download the zip, extract the folder, and open it in your IDE. The module that should be run is hangman_main.py.
  - In the game, only one-letter inputs are considered as guesses. The program does not accept non-alphabet inputs nor repeated guesses.
